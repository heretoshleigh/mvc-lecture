# MVC Lecture
This short talk explains the use of MVC Architecture in JavaScript applications.

### Tech used:
Google Slides :-)

### Optimizations:
With additional time alloted for the lecture, I would add a full walkthrough of a JavaScript application with source code illustrating how a request moves through the MVC architecture as it is being fulfilled.
